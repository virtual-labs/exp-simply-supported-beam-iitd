**POST EXPERIMENT TASK**

1) Compute the frequency for five different lengths of the beam, keeping
all other parameters constant. Plot a graph between frequency and
length.<br>
2) Compute the frequency for five different Young’s modulus of the beam,
keeping all other parameters constant. Plot a graph between frequency
and Young’s modulus.<br><br>
